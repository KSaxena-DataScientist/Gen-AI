This is a Simple RAG project with the following key components

Key Components:
  PDF processing and text extraction
  Text chunking for manageable processing
  Vector store creation using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings
  Retriever setup for querying the processed documents
  Evaluation of the RAG system

Key Features
  Modular Design: The encoding process is encapsulated in a single function for easy reuse.
  Configurable Chunking: Allows adjustment of chunk size and overlap.
  Efficient Retrieval: Uses FAISS for fast similarity search.
